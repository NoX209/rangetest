rangetest.csv viewer for Meshtastic

The live version is available here:
https://deformedweb.co.uk/meshtastic/read-rangetest.html

This code is for viewing a rangetest.csv file saved from a Meshtastic Node. Tested with the file saved from the Android App, not sure about other clients.

It's just the "Export rangetest.csv" in the main menu. Haven't looked at the one from the Rangetest module.

Plots the results on a Leaflet/OSM map. Should work globally.

Once loaded, will be able to filter the data to narrow down the displayed data.

Note: the file is processed entirely in the browser, it is never shared or uploaded. Although OSM tileservers will see what squares you view.
